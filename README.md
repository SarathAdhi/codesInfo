# CodesInfo_website
You might think that there is nothing carzy about the website, the front-end looks shits and nothing complex, But the crazy thing is with the back-end. It is similar to the previous repo or project. Check that out here:- https://github.com/SarathAdhi/Quiz_js_API .

# Just to brush-up, the backend of this website is a excel file (.csv) and another interesting part here is I used wikipedia as a API to visit the particular language.
